<h1>The open movie database(Using API) - JavaFX </h1>

<h3>Designed a GUI that will allow users to access movie information from an OMDB API.</h3>

<p>Created two major model classes to access movie details in two different views, the first view returns the list of the movies when the user triggers an API call and in the second view user can see a lot more details about one particular movie </p>
<p>Utilized HTTP classes to connect to an API and implement a method that will write the JSON data to a file which helps make the troubleshooting easier </p>
